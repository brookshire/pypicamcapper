## Synopsis

pypicamcapper is a script which uses the pycamera module to periodcally capture images from a raspberry pi camera module.

## Motivation

This script provides part of the solution I'm building to capture images of my wedding to build timelapse photo/videos 
after the day is over.  I am going to deploy battery powered Raspberry Pi computers around the hall/room, which will run 
this script, capturing images every 'TBD' seconds.  These images will be POSTed to an HPE Edgeline EL20 via wireless, since 
the Pis will not have a lot of local storage.

## Installation

For now, just run it.

## Tests

TBD

## Contributors

It's on GitHub, so...well, if you're really interested, the normal tools apply.
